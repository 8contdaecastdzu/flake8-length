# How to Add MT8870 DTMF Decoder IC in Proteus 8.0
 
Proteus 8.0 is a popular software for simulating electronic circuits. However, some components may not be available in the default library, such as the MT8870 DTMF decoder IC. This IC can decode the dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals that are used in telephone systems and other applications. In this article, we will show you how to add the MT8870 DTMF decoder IC in Proteus 8.0 and use it in your projects.

## Step 1: Download the MT8870 Proteus Library
 
The first step is to download the MT8870 Proteus library from a reliable source. One such source is [this ResearchGate post](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_do_you_add_MT8870_DTMF_Decoder_IC_In_Proteus_80), where you can find a link to download the library file. Alternatively, you can also download the library from [this Eblal Health Care forum](https://www.eblal.com/forum/questions-answers/mt8870-proteus-lib-downloadl) or [this Xenosystems space website](https://xenosystems.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mt8870_Proteus_Lib_Download.pdf). The library file should have a .lib extension and contain the model and symbol of the MT8870 IC.
 
## Step 2: Import the MT8870 Proteus Library
 
The next step is to import the MT8870 Proteus library into your Proteus software. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Proteus 8.0 and create a new project or open an existing one.
2. Go to Library > Library Manager from the menu bar.
3. Click on Browse Libraries and locate the MT8870 library file that you downloaded.
4. Select the library file and click on Open.
5. The library should appear in the Available Libraries list. Click on Add Library to add it to your project.
6. Click on OK to close the Library Manager.

Now you should be able to find the MT8870 DTMF decoder IC in the Device Selector window under Mixed Mode Logic > DTMF Decoder category.
 
## Step 3: Use the MT8870 DTMF Decoder IC in Your Circuit
 
The final step is to use the MT8870 DTMF decoder IC in your circuit. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Drag and drop the MT8870 IC from the Device Selector window to your schematic.
2. Connect the pins of the IC according to your design requirements. The pinout of the IC is shown below:

4. The VDD and VSS pins are the power supply pins for the IC. You can use a 5V DC source to power the IC.
5. The STD pin is the output pin that indicates when a valid DTMF tone is detected. You can connect an LED or a buzzer to this pin to indicate the tone detection.
6. The Q1-Q4 pins are the output pins that provide a 4-bit binary code corresponding to the decoded DTMF tone. You can connect these pins to a display or a microcontroller to read the decoded tone.
7. The GS pin is an optional input pin that enables or disables guard time between successive tones. You can connect this pin to ground or leave it open depending on your application.
8. The OSC1 and OSC2 pins are connected to an external crystal oscillator that provides the clock frequency for the IC. You can use a 3.579545 MHz crystal oscillator for this purpose.

Once you have connected all the pins of the IC, you can run the simulation
